# Package Map

## Root-Owned Areas

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `MODULE.bazel`, `.bazelversion`, `.bazelrc`, `BUILD.bazel` | Canonical Bazel root and repo entrypoint |
| `docs/` | Human-readable migration, contract, and project documentation |
| `tools/` | Repo-level helper scripts such as Bazel smoke tests |
| `.planning/` | GSD project memory, research, roadmap, and execution metadata |
| `.github/`, `.travis.yml`, `appveyor.yml`, Bright Builds files | Repo metadata and inherited automation surfaces retained at the root |

## Packages

| Package | Role |
|---------|------|
| `packages/legacy-slic3r` | Retained legacy reference package, behavioral oracle, and Bazel-wrapped macOS legacy build/smoke surface |
| `packages/slic3r-rust` | Bright Builds-compliant Rust workspace package with separate implementation, contract, and CLI crate boundaries plus a Bazel-native verification surface |
| `packages/launcher` | Entry-point package boundary that currently points at the Rust CLI and reserves future shell-shim responsibility |
| `packages/parity` | Future owner boundary for parity status and comparison tooling; the current source of truth is still `docs/port/` |
| `packages/parity-fixtures` | Future home for the shared fixture corpus and provenance rules; the corpus is not seeded yet |

## Notes

- The legacy package is visible by design. Contributors should be able to compare the old and new implementation paths directly.
- The trusted Phase 2 oracle set is intentionally narrower than the full retained historical test tree. Today the trusted macOS oracle check is the smoke wrapper, while the broader retained legacy test wrapper remains documented but deferred.
- Root-owned areas stay outside `packages/` so the monorepo does not hide shared orchestration and documentation behind package boundaries.
- The Rust side starts as one top-level package in Phase 1. Phase 3 adds the first real internal crate, `crates/slic3r_core`, without exploding the top-level package list.
- The Phase 4 contract registry lives in `docs/port/contract-inventory.md`, and the contributor-facing launcher/parity/fixture rules live in `docs/port/migration-guidance.md`.
- Phase 5 adds `docs/port/entrypoint-architecture.md` and explicit Rust crate boundaries for launcher contracts and the CLI shell.
- Phase 6 adds `docs/port/cli-slice.md` and makes `--version` the first supported Rust-backed launcher workflow on macOS.
- `packages/parity` and `packages/parity-fixtures` remain future owner boundaries. `packages/launcher` is now a real package boundary, but it still does not imply that user-visible CLI parity has landed yet.
