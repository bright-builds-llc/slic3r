# Slic3r Rust Port

## What This Is

This project modernizes the legacy Slic3r codebase by reorganizing it into a Bazel-driven monorepo and building a new Rust implementation alongside the preserved legacy implementation. The goal is to preserve the existing user-facing and exported contracts with full parity over time while improving readability, reliability, contributor experience, and long-term platform support for maintainers, contributors, and end users.

The legacy codebase remains in the repository as the reference implementation and parity oracle. New Rust work will live beside it under a `packages/`-style layout, with macOS as the first supported platform and the GUI rewrite deferred until the core and CLI migration are credible.

## Core Value

Deliver a trustworthy Rust successor to Slic3r that matches the legacy behavior and interfaces closely enough that the old implementation can eventually be retired without breaking the contracts users and integrators depend on.

## Current Milestone: v1.15 PrusaSlicer Arc-Fitting G-code Evidence Slice

**Goal:** Prove a narrow, source-pinned PrusaSlicer arc-fitting G-code evidence
path through reviewed scope, fixture evidence, Rust parsing/comparison, public
parity/status/docs, and fail-closed mutation guards while keeping broad
generated-output, byte parity, printability, runtime, GUI, non-Prusa fork,
release, upstream import, and sync claims deferred.

**Target features:**

- Reviewed `prusaslicer.arc-fitting` scope contract tied to the existing Prusa
  fork inventory and generated-output deferrals.
- Source-pinned arc-fitting fixture and expected-summary surface suitable for
  executable G-code comparison evidence.
- Pure Rust arc-fitting evidence boundary and registry/readiness metadata that
  remains side-effect-free.
- Public parity command, fail-closed mutation guards, exact status/docs wording,
  and traceability for the narrow arc-fitting slice.

## Last Shipped Milestone: v1.14 PrusaSlicer G-code Semantic Evidence Foundation

**Shipped:** 2026-06-22

**Goal achieved:** Deepened the verified narrow
`fork.prusaslicer.gcode-output` path from structural G-code facts into
semantic toolpath evidence without claiming byte-for-byte parity,
printability, printer-runtime behavior, broad generated-output verification,
support generation, wall seam behavior, arc fitting, GUI behavior,
non-Prusa fork behavior, release behavior, upstream source imports, or sync
automation.

## Current State

v1.15 is the active deliberately narrow PrusaSlicer generated-output feature
slice. It reuses the v1.12-v1.14 G-code evidence ladder, focuses on
`prusaslicer.arc-fitting`, and avoids promoting broad `generated-outputs` or
claiming byte-for-byte, printability, runtime, GUI, non-Prusa fork, release,
upstream import, or sync behavior.

v1.15 Phase 60 is complete and verified. Maintainers can run
`bazel run //packages/parity:prusaslicer_arc_fitting_parity`, inspect the
separate `fork.prusaslicer.arc-fitting` status row, and rely on fixture, scope,
and public parity mutation guards that keep the slice limited to checked-in
PrusaSlicer arc summary evidence. The existing
`fork.prusaslicer.gcode-output` evidence remains separate, while broad
`generated-outputs`, byte-for-byte G-code parity, printability,
printer-runtime behavior, GUI behavior, non-Prusa fork behavior, release
behavior, upstream imports, and sync automation remain deferred.

v1.15 Phase 58 is complete. Maintainers can inspect the source-pinned
`prusaslicer.arc-fitting` fixture namespace, run
`bazel run //packages/parity-fixtures:verify_prusa_arc_fitting_fixture`, and
rely on fail-closed mutation guards for checked-in G2/G3 observations,
provenance, expected arc-summary order, documentation boundaries, checksum
drift, overclaiming text, and absent public `fork.prusaslicer.arc-fitting`
status publication before Phase 60.

v1.14 is archived. The milestone extends the v1.12 and v1.13 Prusa G-code
evidence ladder from marker summaries and structural facts into semantic
toolpath evidence. It created a reviewed semantic field contract,
source-pinned fixture corpus, typed Rust parser/readiness boundary, public
parity validation, mutation guards, and docs that keep broad
`generated-outputs` in progress.

v1.14 Phase 53 is complete. Maintainers can inspect the Phase 53 semantic
Prusa G-code scope contract, run
`bazel run //packages/prusa-gcode-output-scope:verify`, and rely on mutation
guards that keep semantic evidence narrow while generated-output parity,
printability, runtime behavior, support generation, seam behavior, arc
fitting, GUI behavior, release behavior, upstream imports, and sync automation
remain deferred.

v1.14 Phase 54 is complete. Maintainers can inspect the source-pinned
semantic Prusa G-code fixture corpus, run
`bazel run //packages/parity-fixtures:verify_prusa_gcode_output_fixture`, and
rely on mutation guards for semantic summary drift, missing rows, duplicate
rows, out-of-order rows, unsupported fields, unsupported broad-behavior
claims, provenance mismatch, and stale package documentation references.

v1.14 Phase 55 is complete. Developers can parse the Phase 54 semantic summary
artifact through the pure `slic3r_flavors::prusa_gcode_output` Rust boundary,
inspect static semantic readiness metadata through the existing registry
surface, and run Cargo/Bazel coverage proving invalid semantic summaries fail
closed without itself publishing public semantic status. Phase 56 completed
the public executable evidence and status/docs publication step.

v1.14 Phase 56 is complete. Maintainers can run
`bazel run //packages/parity:prusaslicer_gcode_output_parity` for marker,
structural, and semantic expected-summary evidence through the Rust semantic
boundary, inspect fail-closed semantic mutation guards, and read the exact
`fork.prusaslicer.gcode-output` status/package/port docs for the narrow
semantic Prusa G-code evidence slice. Broad `generated-outputs` remains
`in progress`, and byte-for-byte parity, printability, printer-runtime
behavior, support generation, wall seam behavior, arc fitting, GUI behavior,
release behavior, upstream imports, sync automation, and non-Prusa fork
behavior remain deferred.

v1.13 is archived. Maintainers can run
`bazel run //packages/parity:prusaslicer_gcode_output_parity`, inspect the
exact verified `fork.prusaslicer.gcode-output` status row, and read package
and port docs that publish only the narrow structural Prusa G-code evidence
slice. The milestone strengthens the v1.12 marker-level evidence path with a
closed structural scope contract, source-pinned structural sidecar,
fail-closed fixture and scope verifiers, pure typed Rust structural parser and
readiness metadata, public structural parity output, and a
`command_count_g1` mutation guard.

The broad `generated-outputs` status row remains `in progress`, and
byte-for-byte G-code parity, geometry/toolpath parity, printability,
printer-runtime behavior, support generation, wall seam behavior, arc fitting,
GUI export/viewer behavior, release behavior, Bambu Studio, OrcaSlicer,
upstream imports, and sync automation remain deferred.

v1.12 is archived. Maintainers can run
`bazel run //packages/parity:prusaslicer_gcode_output_parity`, see the
`line_4` mutation guard fail closed on expected-summary drift, inspect the
single verified `fork.prusaslicer.gcode-output` status row, and read package
and port docs that identify the exact summary-only evidence slice.

The v1.12 trust chain now covers the reviewed `prusaslicer.gcode-output` scope
record, source-pinned fixture namespace, typed Rust summary boundary, public
Bazel parity command, mutation guard, exact status row, and non-overclaiming
docs. The broad `generated-outputs` status row remains `in progress`, and
byte-for-byte G-code parity, broad generated-output parity, runtime/printer
behavior, geometry, support, seam, arc, STEP, GUI behavior, release,
network/device behavior, Bambu Studio, OrcaSlicer, upstream source imports,
and sync automation remain deferred.

v1.11 is archived. Maintainers can run
`bazel run //packages/parity:prusaslicer_project_file_parity`, inspect the
single `fork.prusaslicer.project-file` verified status row, and review docs
that keep the claim limited to the narrow Prusa project-file expected-summary
evidence slice. The milestone archive records the reviewed scope gate,
source-pinned fixture surface, pure Rust parser boundary, mutation failure
guard, exact status publication, and milestone audit.

v1.10 is archived. Maintainers can still run
`bazel run //packages/parity:prusaslicer_profile_schema_parity`, inspect the
single `fork.prusaslicer.profile-schema` verified status row, and review docs
that keep the claim limited to the narrow Prusa parser/config evidence slice.
The milestone also records reviewer-gated Prusa baseline signoff, checked-in
Prusa profile-schema fixtures, a pure Rust parser/summary boundary, a mutation
failure guard, UAT, and security verification with `threats_open: 0`.

Broader PrusaSlicer runtime support, GUI support, generated-output parity,
fork release builds, profile auto-update execution, network/cloud/credential
behavior, non-free plugin ingestion, and sync automation remain deferred.
Active downstream-fork port planning is limited to PrusaSlicer for now.
Non-Prusa Slicer-family ports, including Bambu Studio and OrcaSlicer, are
speculative parking-lot candidates and are not scheduled roadmap milestones.

v1.11 Phase 41 is complete. Maintainers can inspect the checked-in
`packages/prusa-project-file-scope` scope package, run
`bazel run //packages/prusa-project-file-scope:verify`, and trace
`prusaslicer.project-file` back to the accepted PrusaSlicer source identity and
inventory row before fixtures, parser work, parity targets, or status rows are
introduced. The scope gate completes PSEL-01 and PSEL-02 while keeping broad
3MF import/export, runtime, GUI, generated-output, release, network, plugin,
profile-update, and sync claims deferred.

v1.11 Phase 42 is complete. Maintainers can inspect the checked-in
`packages/parity-fixtures/forks/prusaslicer/prusaslicer.project-file` fixture
namespace, provenance manifest, update rules, and presence-level
`expected-project-summary.tsv`, then run
`bazel run //packages/parity-fixtures:verify_prusa_project_file_fixture` to
validate the source-pinned fixture surface. The fixture surface completes
PFIX-01 and PFIX-02 while keeping Phase 43 Rust parser work and Phase 44
executable parity/status publication unavailable.

v1.11 Phase 43 is complete. Developers can use the pure
`slic3r_flavors::prusa_project_file` boundary to parse and summarize the
Phase 42 expected project summary into typed Rust metadata and presence-level
evidence rows. Registry metadata now traces the project-file surface through
shared typed constants, the fixture verifier allows the reviewed Rust surface,
and docs publish parser readiness without adding the Phase 44 executable
parity target or `fork.prusaslicer.project-file` status row. The boundary
completes PPROJ-01, PPROJ-02, and PPROJ-03.

v1.11 Phase 44 is complete. Maintainers can run
`bazel run //packages/parity:prusaslicer_project_file_parity`, see the command
fail closed on expected-artifact drift, inspect the exact
`fork.prusaslicer.project-file` status row, and read docs that keep full
PrusaSlicer runtime, GUI, generated-output, release, network/device,
profile-update, and sync surfaces deferred. The executable parity slice
completes PPEV-01, PPEV-02, and PPEV-03.

<summary>v1.9 shipped fork vendor intake and module architecture</summary>

v1.9 delivered:

- `packages/fork-vendors/forks.tsv` and
  `bazel run //packages/fork-vendors:verify`, giving maintainers pinned
  PrusaSlicer, Bambu Studio, and OrcaSlicer source refs, branch observations,
  lineage, source paths, refresh commands, SPDX metadata, provenance notes, and
  caution flags without cloning, fetching, building, or vendoring upstream fork
  repositories
- `packages/fork-inventories`, source-pinned per-fork inventory TSVs, and an
  exact-once cross-fork category map that classify base, shared downstream,
  fork-specific, and deferred source-observed planning inputs without treating
  them as executable fork parity
- typed Rust contracts in `slic3r_contracts` for downstream fork identity,
  flavor identity, vendor source identity, feature origin, parity surface, and
  checklist status
- a pure `slic3r_flavors` registry crate with hand-curated static metadata,
  lookup helpers, provenance tests, Cargo/Bazel verification, and no runtime
  Git, filesystem, network, process, release, sync, or TSV parsing side
  effects
- fork parity checklist, fixture namespace, launcher-shape, manual drift
  refresh, and deferral templates that reserve verified fork status for future
  executable evidence

The first recommended executable slice is Prusa profile schema/config parity
because it is fork-specific, medium complexity, and can build on the already
verified config/config-persistence evidence instead of jumping directly to
high-risk generated-output or network/cloud surfaces.

## Next Milestone Goals

- Scope v1.15 as a PrusaSlicer arc-fitting evidence milestone before adding new
  phase work.
- Reuse the v1.12-v1.14 G-code evidence ladder instead of widening
  `generated-outputs` from one semantic Prusa G-code path.
- Keep support generation, wall seam behavior, STEP import, full 3MF
  import/export, printer runtime behavior, and other generated-output feature
  slices as future Prusa candidates until scoped by later requirements.
- Limit active downstream-fork porting consideration to PrusaSlicer for now;
  Bambu Studio, OrcaSlicer, cross-flavor build automation, and nightly vendor
  sync remain paused until an explicit new planning decision reopens them.

  evidence command, planned status token, docs touched, license/security note,

- ✓ v1.15 proves a reviewed `prusaslicer.arc-fitting` scope contract before
  fixture, Rust, parity, status, or docs work can claim evidence — Phase 57
- ✓ v1.15 adds source-pinned arc-fitting fixture evidence and expected
  summaries without importing upstream source trees or generating broad G-code
  parity claims — Phase 58
- ✓ v1.15 adds a pure Rust arc-fitting evidence boundary that parses checked-in
  caller-supplied artifacts without Git, network, filesystem discovery,
  process, release, sync, or runtime side effects — Phase 59
- ✓ v1.15 publishes executable arc-fitting parity/status/docs evidence only for
  the narrow PrusaSlicer arc-fitting slice, keeping broad generated-output,
  byte-for-byte, printability, runtime, GUI, non-Prusa fork, release, upstream
  import, and sync behavior deferred — Phase 60

### Active

None. v1.15 phase requirements are complete and ready for milestone audit.

### Out of Scope

- GUI migration planning and implementation remain out of scope until the
  fork-parity evidence path is credible enough not to destabilize the base
  migration track
- Signing, notarization, AppImage, MSI, DMG, installer parity, and
  release-channel publishing remain future packaging/release work beyond the
  current base artifact automation
- Broad feature redesign or new CLI slices beyond the currently verified
  surface remain secondary to release automation and GUI strategy decisions
- Treating the legacy package as an active feature-development surface — it
  remains the reference implementation except for minimal oracle upkeep
- Full PrusaSlicer parity remains outside the current milestone beyond the
  narrow evidence slices it explicitly implements.
- Non-Prusa Slicer-family ports, including Bambu Studio and OrcaSlicer, are
  paused parking-lot candidates; v1.9 artifacts remain historical planning and
  architecture inputs, not active roadmap commitments.
- Fork-flavor build automation is a paused parking-lot candidate until
  executable fork evidence and an explicit future planning decision define
  supported flavors.
- Nightly vendor sync and Codex-assisted merge automation are paused
  parking-lot candidates until stable fork modules, executable evidence, and
  review-gated refresh policy exist.
- Byte-for-byte Prusa G-code parity remains deferred until a larger reviewed
  fixture corpus and stricter output-generation oracle exist.
- Printability, firmware/runtime behavior, host upload, post-processing,
  thumbnails, support generation, and wall seam behavior remain deferred beyond
  v1.15; arc fitting is active only for the narrow v1.15 evidence slice.

## Context

The current Slic3r codebase is a hybrid desktop and CLI application built from Perl, XS bindings, vendored C/C++, and a wxWidgets GUI. It already performs valuable work and exposes the contracts that matter, but the codebase is increasingly hard to maintain and is drifting toward effective unmaintainability.

The motivation for this port is modernization rather than novelty. The new implementation needs to improve readability, reliability, contributor experience, and long-term platform support without losing the behavior, formats, and workflows that existing users and integrators rely on.

The repo now has a fresh brownfield codebase map under `.planning/codebase/`, which documents the current architecture, stack, integrations, conventions, testing patterns, and known concerns. That map should be treated as the baseline reference for migration planning.

The current codebase still contains a split between newer native test/build flows and older Perl/XS/bootstrap flows, plus legacy CI and packaging scripts. Bazel is intended to become the top-level organizing build system that can orchestrate both the retained legacy package and the new Rust packages from one coherent entrypoint.

The audience for this work is broad:

- internal maintainers who need a sustainable modernization strategy
- contributors who need a readable, well-documented path to help with the port
- end users who need confidence that the Rust rewrite preserves the behavior they depend on

## Constraints

- **Build System**: Bazel is the top-level build and test entrypoint for the repository — to unify the monorepo and standardize how legacy and Rust packages are built
- **Reference Preservation**: The legacy codebase must stay buildable and usable as the parity oracle — to reduce migration risk and preserve a trustworthy comparison target
- **Parity**: Public and exported contracts must be preserved with full-parity intent across all externally visible surfaces — to avoid regressions for users and integrators
- **Platform Priority**: macOS comes first for the new implementation — because that is the active development platform and the fastest path to validated progress
- **Migration Shape**: The migration is phased coexistence, not big-bang replacement — because the legacy implementation is the reference and the Rust implementation will mature beside it
- **Implementation Standards**: The Rust codebase must comply with the Bright Builds Coding and Architecture Requirements — to improve readability, reliability, and maintainability from the start
- **Launcher Strategy**: The active implementation should move away from Perl, using Rust, Bazel, shell scripts, or thin shims where they provide the clearest replacement path — to reduce dependence on the legacy runtime model
- **Documentation Discipline**: Port-progress docs and checklists in `docs/` must be updated alongside Rust changes by process — to keep parity status and migration intent visible as the code evolves

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Adopt a Bazel-driven monorepo with a `packages/` layout | The migration needs one top-level build/test system that can host both legacy and Rust implementations coherently | ✓ Shipped in v1.0 |
| Retain the legacy Slic3r implementation as a reference package instead of rewriting in place | The old code should remain the oracle for parity and reduce migration risk | ✓ Shipped in v1.0 |
| Build the new implementation in Rust under Bright Builds standards | The port exists to improve readability, reliability, contributor experience, and long-term maintainability | ✓ Shipped in v1.0 |
| Target full parity across exported contracts, but defer GUI rewrite from the initial milestone | Core behavior and contract preservation matter first; GUI replacement can follow once the foundations are trustworthy | ✓ v1.0 foundation shipped, broader parity still active |
| Prioritize macOS first and defer Linux/Windows parity work | Current development happens on macOS, so that is the most practical first validation target | ✓ Shipped in v1.0 |
| Replace the active Perl launcher path with a documented Rust/Bazel/shell strategy | The migration should remove Perl from the preferred path without losing the current user-facing behavior | ✓ First Rust-backed slice shipped in v1.0 |
| Add a parity-check command that covers both status reporting and behavior comparison over time | The project needs both visible progress tracking and evidence-based parity validation | ✓ Shipped in v1.0 |
| Require migration docs and checklists under `docs/` by process before adding automation | Documentation discipline is important immediately, but hard enforcement can follow once the workflow settles | ✓ Process shipped in v1.0 |
| Treat GitHub Actions uploaded artifacts as the v1.8 release build surface | The project needed repeatable downloadable artifacts before release-channel publishing, signing, or installers | ✓ Shipped in v1.8 |
| Reuse packaged launcher parity as the release build evidence gate | Release automation should rely on the same checked-in evidence as the packaging-visible parity surface | ✓ Shipped in v1.8 |
| Embed release provenance inside each package tree | Maintainers need platform, commit, build mode, scope, package target, and evidence target visible in every artifact | ✓ Shipped in v1.8 |
| Treat source-pinned fork inventories as planning inputs, not runtime parity evidence | v1.9 needs feature ownership and scope metadata before fork behavior becomes implementation work | ✓ Shipped in Phase 33 |
| Model downstream fork and flavor metadata as typed Rust contracts before registry or core logic | Raw vendor strings, source pins, feature origins, parity surfaces, and checklist status labels should not leak across Rust boundaries | ✓ Shipped in Phase 34 |
| Use one shared `slic3r_flavors` crate instead of vendor-specific Rust workspaces | Future fork behavior should plug into shared capability metadata without copying base Rust workspace structure per vendor | ✓ Shipped in Phase 35 |
| Keep the flavor registry metadata-only and side-effect free | v1.9 registry data should be inspectable and testable without Git, filesystem, network, process, release, sync, or runtime parsing side effects | ✓ Shipped in Phase 35 |
| Reserve verified fork status for future executable evidence | Source pins, inventories, docs, and templates are necessary planning inputs but do not prove runtime fork behavior | ✓ Shipped in Phase 36 |
| Keep drift refresh manual and reviewer-gated until fork modules and fixtures exist | Automated vendor sync is unsafe before stable executable evidence and review boundaries exist | ✓ Shipped in Phase 36 |
| Keep the Prusa profile boundary pure and caller-supplied until executable parity owns status publication | Phase 39 needs typed parser and provenance data without Git, network, filesystem discovery, process, release, sync, or premature status-row side effects | ✓ Shipped in Phase 39 |
| Start fork implementation with a narrow PrusaSlicer evidence foundation instead of a full fork port | Prusa is the cleanest first downstream fork, and a profile/config slice proves the evidence workflow without high-risk generated-output or network/cloud scope | ✓ Shipped in v1.10 |
| Gate Prusa project-file parity behind a checked-in scope package before fixtures, parser work, parity targets, or status rows | Project-file support is close enough to broad 3MF/runtime behavior that maintainers need a reviewed evidence contract before implementation can make claims | ✓ Shipped in Phase 41 |
| Keep Prusa project-file fixture TSVs exact instead of append-only | Phase 42 fixture artifacts are a narrow evidence surface, so extra provenance or expected-summary rows could overclaim parser or parity behavior while the verifier still passed | ✓ Shipped in Phase 42 |
| Publish project-file parity only as a narrow expected-summary evidence slice | Phase 44 proves command/status wiring without claiming full 3MF import/export, GUI project behavior, runtime semantics, or generated-output parity | ✓ Shipped in Phase 44 |
| Start generated-output work with summary-only G-code evidence | G-code is closer to real port value than another static input slice, but byte-for-byte output parity and printer-runtime claims are too broad for the first generated-output milestone | ✓ Shipped in v1.12 Phase 48 |
| Limit active downstream-fork porting consideration to PrusaSlicer for now | Non-Prusa Slicer-family ports need an explicit new planning decision before moving from parking lot into the roadmap | ✓ Adopted 2026-06-03 |
| Expand Prusa G-code evidence structurally before broad generated-output parity | v1.12 proved the evidence path, but support, seam, arc, geometry, runtime, and byte parity should wait until structural G-code summaries can fail closed on meaningful drift | ✓ Shipped in v1.13 Phase 52 |
| Deepen Prusa G-code evidence semantically before feature-specific generated-output slices | Support, seam, arc, and broad generated-output status need semantic toolpath comparison machinery before their own evidence can be credible | ✓ Shipped in v1.14 Phase 56 |
| Use arc fitting as the next Prusa generated-output feature slice | Arc fitting is a medium-complexity generated-output candidate that can reuse the v1.12-v1.14 G-code evidence ladder without jumping to support generation, broad generated-output parity, or non-Prusa fork work | ✓ Shipped in v1.15 Phase 60 |
